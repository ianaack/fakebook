  ## Deployment
  The application is a backend API only so there is no application deployment.

  In order to see how the application works check out: [Usage](Usage).

  To test the routes yourself and see the full capabilities check out: [Tests](Tests)

  Here are some screenshots of the example routes

  ## Tests
  Tests for the application functionality were performed using Insomnia.

  If you would like to test out the various routes you can follow these instructions:

  - git clone the repository with either HTTP or SSH
  ```bash
  git clone
  ```
  - install the necessary dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  - once the dependencies are installed, start the server
  ```bash
  node server
  ```
  - within insomnia make calls to access the different models and routes
  
  To GET all users & POST a user:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:3001/api/users
  ```
  To GET all thoughts & POST a thought:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts
  ```
  From these routes you can PUT, and DELETE data as well, using the created _id.

  Using this _id string is also how you create friend connections, and reply to thoughts.
